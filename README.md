# PyTask

Hello here is a project that is not finished but I still wanted to upload something to github, so here is **PyTask**. If you want to learn more about PyTask, you can read me. Once you have finished reading this, you should understand the basics of PyTask. For more indepth with code example kinda stuff look to the wiki!


# Commands

PyTask has a **plethora** of commands... ok so that may be a lie but there are some commands so let's go over them.

## Add

The add command is the most vital part of PyTask. Without it this wouldn't even be a task manager. Using it is really simple (for the most part) but if you would like more in-depth explanations look at the wiki.
`add [TITLE] [DESC] [LABEL]`


## Rm

The rm command is another useful tool for managing your tasks. Make a error naming your task don't worry just remove it and make a new one.
`rm [TITLE]`

## Edit

The edit command is a nice thing to have to edit/add a desc to you task. This can be done when making a task, but it can also be done using this command.
`edit [TITLE] [DESC]`

## State

The state command is a bit confusing at first but don't worry it is simple. The state command can also be called a "label" command. This command allows for the creation of "states" E.g. [DOING], or [DONE] but you are not limited to those two options.
`state [TITLE] [LABEL]`

## Clear

The clear command will clear your todo list. So basically it will wipe all that work you should be doing but you wont. Good job you are now one step closer to my school life :)

## Cls

The cls command will clear your screen. It is different then the clear command in the fact that it wont delete anything. Unless your screen.. yeah it deletes your screen.

## Load

The load command will load a txt or json file. Pretty self explanatory.
`load [EXT]`

## Export

The export command will export your todo list in a txt or json file. Pretty self explanatory.
`export [EXT]`

## Path

The path command will change the location that the script stores it's exports and where it will take files to load.
`path [LOCATION]`

## Log

The log command will show a log of all actions done. Pretty simple.

## Help

The help command is the built-in documentation. If COMMAND parameter is left blank a list of all commands will be shown.
`help [COMMAND]`

## Quit
The quit command is well the quit command. Need I say more?
